## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Reasoning Engine** â€“ Tree-of-Thoughts + Symbolic logic modules
- **Hierarchical Memory** â€“ Working, episodic, semantic, procedural
- **Adaptive Learning** â€“ Meta-learning for continual task adaptation
- **Efficiency First** â€“ Sparse compute, modular activation, memory offloading

## ðŸ“– System Overview

**Synapse** is designed to **think and learn like a human brain**:

1. **Perception Hub** â€“ Encodes multimodal input  
2. **Reasoning Engine** â€“ Combines neural + symbolic reasoning  
3. **Memory System** â€“ Hierarchical storage & retrieval  
4. **Adaptation Core** â€“ Learns how to learn across environments
